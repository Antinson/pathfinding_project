## Problem

At work, we often have multiple tasks to complete in a store, and these tasks are provided in a task list that isn't organized in the most optimal order. The task list usually consists of row numbers, and this unorganized nature leads to inefficient task completion. Below is an example of how tasks might be listed:

(Insert an image of the unorganized task list here)

## Solution

This project leverages pathfinding algorithms to determine the most efficient path to complete all tasks. By processing images to locate the task points on a grid, the program generates an optimal path that reduces time and effort.

## Features

- Image Processing: Detects and maps task locations from images.
- Pathfinding Algorithm: Calculates the most efficient route to complete all tasks.
- Grid Visualization: Displays tasks on a grid with the optimal path.
